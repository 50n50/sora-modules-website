# sora-modules
Website made by [me](https://github.com/ordzy) made for the following reasons:
- Browse for modules
- Redirect to Sora app to install modules
- Copy module URL for fallback if no redirect

Credit goes to [50/50](https://github.com/50n50) for making the modules.
- If a module is missing, check [50/50's sources](https://github.com/50n50/sources?tab=readme-ov-file#available-module), because I might not have updated it at the time.
